# DH110 Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype
### Yongsen Huang - Spring 2023

## Introduction
This interactive prototype for TribeTrack aims to improve the visualization and interactivity of information within a limited screen size, compared to the low-fidelity prototype created previously. It also validates the interaction flow, branching out based on the user's choices. In this high-fidelity interactive prototype, I will ask the user to perform the same two tasks as before, but with a better-designed interface and layout. My intention is to enable the user to easily navigate through all operations without encountering any difficulties.

## Two Desgined Tasks
1. During the testing of the high-fidelity prototype of TribeTrack, the tester was asked to perform two tasks. The first task involved setting up an emergency call to their mom's phone number through the safety page. To accomplish this, the tester navigated to the "Location" page from the homepage, where they were able to access the emergency call function. After completing the call to their mom, they returned to the homepage.
2. The second task required the tester to set up a new geofence from the homepage, specifically adding a new place and inputting it as their home address. The tester was able to do this with ease, navigating through the interface and customizing the geofence size and name as needed.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
[Zoom Recording](https://ucla.zoom.us/rec/share/07O7Rt8ozPZWdr8QG_e2u9q2iv8v3CSKXaoE6S9YJ84xJW08-reCoJNTwLlXVZBU.FlWEaXXcA-AW9Qxv)

The cognitive walkthrough went smoothly, but we made some discoveries during the test. The first task proceeded well, as I let the tester complete it without any intervention. However, I found that one of the interaction designs only covered the plus sign, rather than the entire interface. I made the necessary changes afterwards.

During the second task, the tester encountered a problem when trying to drag the geofence area circle from the shortcut way. I noted this issue and made the necessary fix. I also walked the tester through the proper way to complete the task, which they were able to do quickly.

The tester did not encounter any misdirections, so I directed them to the error prevention pages as well. Following this, I asked the tester the following questions:

1. What do you think about the visibility of this app?
> It looks good.
3. Can you go back to the previous frame?
> Yes.
4. Do you have error prevention and are you able to exit the error prevention?
> Yes.
5. Did you think you could perform the task without any hints? What about tasks that require pure memorization?
> It may be unclear the first time (for the second task), but it should become clearer after that.
6. Do you find the operations simple and easy to understand?
> Yes
7. Do you have any suggestions?
> Not really.
